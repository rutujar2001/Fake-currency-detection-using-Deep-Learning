# Fake-currency-detection-using-Deep-Learning
The project aims to automate the detection of genuine and fake currency notes using image processing techniques.
The system utilizes Morphological Algorithm for accurate recognition. 
The process involves capturing currency images, preprocessing for normalization, extracting and applying morphology for analysis.
